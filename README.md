# Processor

We have designed a custom processor capable of downsampling a given image by a factor of 2 on the Verilog environment. The main requirements of the processor were filtering and downsampling. Finally, we compared the downsampled output image of our processor with a downsampled output image obtained by Python and we calculated the standard error (SSD) to verify the implementation.
